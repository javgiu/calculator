Calculator with basics operations

I recently added the keyboard support. This are some of the specifications:

    1-Press Ctrl to change the number sign from positive to negative and vice versa
    2-Press Esc to clear the display
    3-Press Enter is like pressing the "=" button
    4-Press "Shift+5" or your "%" character to execute the percentage operation
    5-The numbers works as expected same as the operators, jus Press them in your keyboard

Enjoy it!
